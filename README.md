# rapGO.io : an experimental platform for generating a rap from any input voice.

When I initially started this project, I wanted to dig deeper in the audio manipulation of sounds. 
Then I wanted to add a scalable infrastructure layer using Kubernetes and a distributed filesystem.

This project is a kind of training for deploying a complex kubernetes application with several microservices
powered by several languages like Go, C, Python and Reactjs for the frontend services.

For now, the `src/rapgeneratorservice/lib` which is the core of the application is a bit simple and the results are very far from being audible. However, I'm improving this core library over the time to create a better user experience.

To learn more about the architecture of rapGO.io, please refer to the [docs](/docs/README.md) section.
